# Satelite Capacity Allocation using Markov Decision Process

The problem is the optimization of a satellite network controller where messages from two sources arrive. This problem can be handled as a queuing system with two independent Poisson arrival processes. The satellite network controller has no queue and has a limited capacity, therefore the messages that the controller does not admit will never be handled. With this rejection, some costs arise. Messages that are admitted will be handled for some discrete time units. The number of time units they will be handled for has a certain probability distribution. The purpose is to create a policy for the controller of the satellite network in regards to which messages it has to admit and which messages it has to reject in order to minimize the costs.
